# Job_Recommendations
Overview
This project is a Python-based job recommendation system that leverages Google's Generative AI to provide personalized job recommendations for students based on their academic performance, course completion, and other achievements. The system generates tailored job descriptions, salary ranges, and personalized advice, which are then stored in a MongoDB database for easy retrieval and analysis.

Features
Personalized Job Recommendations: Generates job descriptions tailored to the student's academic performance and achievements.

AI-Powered: Utilizes Google's Generative AI (gemini-1.5-pro-latest) to create dynamic and relevant job recommendations.

Data Storage: Stores generated job recommendations in a MongoDB database for future reference.

Data Analysis: Uses pandas to display and analyze the stored job recommendations in a tabular format.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Required Python libraries:

pandas

pymongo

google-generativeai

MongoDB (local or remote instance)
